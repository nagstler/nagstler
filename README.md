Hey 🧑‍💻

I am an Engineering Leader and product builder with a passion for startups, entrepreneurship, and technology.

I love building products that solve real-world problems, leading engineering teams of all sizes, and taking ideas from scratch to scale.

I’m a big fan of open-source and have built projects like [Multiwoven](https://github.com/Multiwoven/multiwoven), a leading reverse ETL platform used by data teams globally.

Rubyist and Javascripter at heart 🫶
